It is a programming language which is quite versatile for different sorts of projects and easy for beginners to read and grasp.<br></br>\n\nFirstly , everything about Python is free and available online. The language is open-sourced and free to use for everyone. Basically you just need to install Python on your PC or laptop, find a text editor to write your code and finally use your terminal or command prompt to execute your programs .\n\nAccording to me ,these are the points that makes Python a great programming language.<br></br><br></br>\n\n                                <ul class=\"list-group\">\n                                    <li class=\"list-group-item\" id=\"special\">1.

This makes it easier to type than some other programming language.\n\nSecondly, Python uses proper indentation as a way of making the code structurally more appealing and cleaner.It also helps in spotting errors and bugs in the code too.<br></br><br></br>\n\n                                <strong>Versatility</strong><br></br>\n                                Since Python is a not oriented for any specific type of usage, programmers use it for a variety of projects. Whether you want to create games, web apps or even data mining, Python provide you with the tools to do so.\n\nFor a beginner , this versatility is amazing. You might not have a clear idea of what you want to accomplish but after you go through a few exercises , you’ll soon spot the ones you find most intriguing\n\nMoreover, Python has a wide collection of standard libraries and additional packages.This makes it even more easier for beginners to start working on practical projects early on.<br></br><br></br>\n\n                                <strong>Rapid Growth</strong><br></br>\n                                Once you get started with Python, you’ll eventually be writing small programs of your own. Because of the clear and easy to learn syntax, you’ll easily get the hang of it. Consequently, Python lets you start thinking like a programmer rather quickly.\n\nI personally found it extremely helpful that Python reads just as English. For solving problems , you can write some “pseudo code ” first,listing the procedures necessary to achieve your goal .\n\nAfter a few days of practice , your pseudo code will magically resemble real Python code.\n\nIn other words, Python’s simple and clear syntax allows you to focus on creating solutions for your problem quickly.This was one of the things that kept me motivated with Python: being able to write your own little program so soon felt so satisfying!!<br></br><br></br>\n\n                                <strong>Availability of resources</strong><br></br>\n                                I got started with Python by taking online course. Just googling python courses gives you millions and millions of websites where you could learn Python which can be a bit much sometimes. That’s why I’ve listed my favorite resources for beginners to start Python right now.<br></br><br></br>\n                                <ul class=\"list-group\">\n                                    <li class=\"list-group-item\" id=\"special\"><strong>Udemy</strong> : This is an online learning platform where you can learn about anything including programming languages such as Python.
